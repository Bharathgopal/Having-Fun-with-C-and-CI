### Discussion Points/Checklist
* Need for dynamic memory and flexibility
* Heap usage, API usage - malloc, calloc, realloc, free
* Dynamic Memory for 
  * 1D Arrays | 2D Arrays |  structure variables | array of structure variables
* Flexible Array Member(FAM) [FAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_array_member)
* Memory leaks - examples 
* Valgrind use for memory leak detection
* Other Heap errors
  * Read/write after free
  * Read/write beyond heap block size
  * Mismatch between allocation & release
  * Invalid base address to free
  * Double free
